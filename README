Code to transmit data from the raspi to the multitech router for the Beacon lora Project.

To install on a RPI:

1) copy this repo to the raspi.  It is preferred to get the raspi on the internet (for setup), and then run:
git clone https://github.com/dHutchings/beacon_lora.git

2) copy the rules files into /etc/udev/rules.d.  You will need sudo, so the command will look:
sudo cp *.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

3) Using "sudo visudo", add the following line to the bottom of the file:
ALL ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/date

4) open up transmit_data.sh, and change the absolute paths to be what you want.
There are 4 to do: lines 7,45,47,57.

5) Attach ./transmit_data.sh to a cronjob, using sudo crontab -e.  Run once an hour or day.
